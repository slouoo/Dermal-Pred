# Dermal-Pred

Basic:
Dermal Pred is a software used for predicting Acute Dermal Toxicity.

Use:
For single molecule prediction, directly enter the SMILES of the molecule at the SMILES string, and clicks Run and Get the rusults to get the prediction result.
For the prediction of multiple molecules, place the SMILES of multiple molecules in the first column of the txt file, and click Run and Get the rusults to get the prediction result.
The prediction results will also be exported in csv format (the default path is the path where the exe file is located), which can be modified by the user. example: C:\Users\slou\Desktop
